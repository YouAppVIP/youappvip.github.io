        Creation and use of Accounts are subject to the following terms and conditions:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          When you create or update an Account, you must provide YouApp with accurate and up-to-date information that
          is
          personal to you, including, but not limited to, your name and email address. Additionally, in order to create
          a
          fan account or use certain features offered on the Platform, you will also be required to provide YouApp with
          additional profile information. YouApp shall also have the right to obtain non-personal information related to
          your connection to the Platform. YouApp’s ability to collect, use, store, and share your personal and
          non-personal
          information is limited by YouApp’s Privacy Policy.

          You must maintain the confidentiality of your password, as you are responsible for all uses of your Account,
          including any purchases, whether or not authorized by you. If you become aware of or reasonably suspect any
          breach
          of security, including without limitation any loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your Account
          password,
          you must immediately notify YouApp at <a href="mailto:support@youapp.vip">support@YouApp.vip</a>.

      </ul>

      <p>
        You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using your Account. If you choose a
        recurring subscription for any YouApp products or services, you acknowledge that payments may be processed
        automatically (e.g., charged to your credit card) until you cancel your subscription or your Account. YouApp may
        revise the pricing for the goods and services offered through the Platform at any time. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY
        PROVIDED IN THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUAPP IS NOT REQUIRED TO REFUND AMOUNTS YOU
        PAY

        Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Platform are made available

      <h2>
        License Limitations
      </h2>

      <p>
        While YouApp does not actively monitor Content uploaded to the Platform, YouApp reserves the right to suspend or
        revoke your license to use the Platform or Content, or parts, components and/or single features thereof, if you

          available
          any features or functionality of the Platform to any person or entity, whether or not over a network and

          rights to the Platform or Content to any other party in any way not expressly authorized herein.
        </li>

        <li>
          Engage in Disruption or Harassment of Third Parties. You shall not engage in any conduct intended to disrupt
          or

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        Rights to User Content
      </h2>

      <p>
        As an Account holder you may submit User Content to the Platform, including sound recordings, pictures, videos,
        text, messages, information, playlist information, comments and/or other types of content. You understand that
        YouApp does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any User Content you submit.
      </p>

      <p>
        You shall be solely responsible for your own User Content and the consequences of submitting and publishing your
        User Content on the Platform. You affirm, represent, and warrant that you own or have the necessary licenses,
        rights, consents, and permissions to publish User Content you submit; and you license to YouApp all patent,
        trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to such User Content for publication on
        the
        Platform pursuant to this End User License Agreement.
      </p>

      <p>
        For clarity, you retain all of your ownership rights in your User Content. Further, YouApp will not share your
        User Content with third parties outside of the Platform without first obtaining your explicit consent to do so.
        However, by submitting User Content to YouApp, YouApp requires the following license from you in order to
        operate
        the Platform and perform the services requested.
      </p>

      <p>
        You hereby grant YouApp a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sub licensable and transferable license to
        use,
        reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the User Content in connection with the
        operation of the Platform and YouApp's (and its successors' and affiliates') business, including without
        limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Platform (and derivative works thereof) in any
        media formats and through any media channels. You also hereby grant each user of the Platform a non-exclusive
        license to access your User Content through the Platform for non-commercial purposes, and to use, reproduce,
        distribute, display and perform such User Content as permitted through the functionality of the Platform and
        under
        this End User License Agreement. The above licenses granted by you in sound recording User Content you submit to
        the Platform terminate within a commercially reasonable time after you remove or delete your sound recordings
        from
        the Platform. You understand and agree, however, that YouApp may retain, but not display, distribute, or
        perform,
        server copies of your sound recordings that have been removed or deleted.
      </p>

      <p>
        You further agree that User Content you submit to the Platform will not contain third party copyrighted
        material,
        or material that is subject to other third party proprietary rights, unless you have permission from the
        rightful
        owner of the material or you are otherwise legally entitled to post the material and to grant YouApp all of the
        license rights granted herein. Where applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive any
        “moral rights” (or the equivalent under applicable law), such as your right to be identified as the author of
        any
        User Content, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content. If such moral rights are
        not
        waivable, then you at least agree not to sue us for failure to identify you as the author of any User Content or
        for any use of your User Content on the Platform.
      </p>

      <p>
        YouApp does not endorse any User Content submitted to the Platform by any user or other licensor, or any
        opinion,
        recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and YouApp expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection
        with User Content. YouApp does not permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of intellectual
        property rights on the Platform, and YouApp will remove all Content if properly notified that such Content
        infringes on another's intellectual property rights. YouApp reserves the right to remove User Content without
        prior notice.
      </p>

      <p>
        You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on the Platform, (i) such User Content, or its use
        by
        YouApp as contemplated by this End User License Agreement, does not violate the publicity, personality, or other
        rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by YouApp or any other
        creator, artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from such individual or
        entity,
        and (ii) no royalties or other fees will be payable by YouApp to any third party for the reproduction,
        distribution, public display, public performance, creation of derivative works, or other use or exploitation of
        such User Content.
      </p>

      <p>
        YouApp may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content. Because there is a risk to hosting
        user uploaded content, including User Content, YouApp reserves the right, in all cases, to remove or disable
        access to any User Content for any or no reason, including, but not limited to, User Content that, in YouApp’s
        sole discretion, violates this End User License Agreement, the rights of any third party, poses a reputational
        risk to YouApp or any other person, or would cause YouApp to be in breach of any agreement to which YouApp is a
        party. YouApp may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party and without any
        liability to you for such removal. However, YouApp does not obligate itself to remove any User Content except as
        required by law.
      </p>

      <p>
        You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post, so please be careful about what you post. Don’t
        defame people on the Platform. As you would expect, YouApp is not responsible for User Content nor does it
        endorse
        any opinion contained in any User Content. YOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST YouApp RELATED TO
        USER
        CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD YouApp HARMLESS
        FROM
        AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS)
        ARISING
        OUT OF SUCH CLAIM AND/OR YOUR BREACH OF THE REPRESENTATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please be thoughtful about how you use the Platform and what you share, and especially how you interact with
        your
        fans on the Platform. The Platform includes social and interactive features, including the ability to post User
        Content, share content, and make certain information about you public. Remember that shared or publicly
        available
        information may be used and re-shared by other users on the Platform or across the web, and may live on in

      <h2>
        Beta Testing and Pre-Release Versions
      </h2>

      <p>
        Certain pre-release versions of YouApp products and services may be made available to you through the Platform
        for
        testing (a “Beta Test”).
      </p>

      <p>
        During and after the Beta Test, you may be provided with an opportunity to give YouApp your comments,
        suggestions
        and impressions of the Platform by using tools to supply feedback and bug reports, internal websites and forums,
        and other methods. The Platform may also include a tool that will allow your computer, console or mobile device
        to
        forward system and driver information to YouApp in the event of a crash. This tool may collect data from your
        computer, console or mobile device related to the crash, and allow you to forward a report to YouApp via
        electronic mail.
      </p>

      <p>
        You acknowledge that: (a) the Platform being Beta Tested is a work in progress and may contain bugs which may
        cause loss of data and/or damage to your computer, console or mobile device; (b) you have, or will, back-up your
        device prior to installation or use of the Beta Test Platform; (c) you have the resources necessary to easily
        reinstall the Beta Test’s Platform and restore any and all data that may be lost; (d) YouApp is not liable in
        any
        way for the loss of data or damage that is incurred during the Beta Test, including, but not limited to,
        interruptions of service, software or hardware failures, or loss of data or disruption of service; (e) YouApp
        may
        monitor and record any and all communications, electronic or otherwise, pertaining to the Beta Test; (f) YouApp
        may delete or modify the information (including any User Content) stored by the Platform being Beta Tested for
        any
        reason at any time during the duration of the Beta Test; and (g) you may not sell, transfer or commercially
        exploit access to a Beta Test, without YouApp’s express authorization.
      </p>

      <p>
        YouApp can terminate a Beta Test at any time. When YouApp terminates a Beta Test, you must delete the
        pre-release
        version of the Platform that was the subject of the Beta Test. You agree and acknowledge that YouApp’s
        termination
        of the Beta Test shall not be grounds for any refunds of any kind. Your participation in a Beta Test shall not
        entitle you to a license to the Platform at the end of the Beta Test.
      </p>

      <p>
        When participating in a Beta Test, the terms of this section shall supersede and govern over any other section
        of
        this End User License Agreement which may be in conflict with the terms of this section.

      <h2>Apple Device Terms</h2>

      <p>
        This section applies to users that use the Platform through an application on an Apple device (e.g., iPhone,
        iPad,
        iPod Touch) (any such device, an “Apple Device”); this section does not apply to users that do not use the
        Platform on an Apple Device. The parties acknowledge that this End User License Agreement is concluded solely
        between you and YouApp, and not with Apple, and Apple is not responsible for the Platform and the content
        thereof.
        Any support that may be offered by YouApp in connection with the Platform is solely the responsibility of YouApp
        and it is acknowledged by the parties that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and
        support services with respect to the Platform. The parties acknowledge that Apple has no obligation to furnish
        any
        warranty with respect to the Platform. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no
        other
        warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Platform. The parties acknowledge that Apple is not
        responsible
        for addressing product claims. Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims of any end-user or any third
        party relating to the Platform or the end-user’s possession and/or use of that Platform, including, but not
        limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Platform fails to conform to any applicable
        legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation. The
        parties acknowledge that, in the event of any third party claim that the Platform or your possession and use of
        the Platform infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, Apple will not be responsible for the
        investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim. The
        parties
        acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of this End User
        License
        Agreement, and that, upon your acceptance of this End User License Agreement, Apple will have the right (and
        will
        be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this End User License Agreement against you as a third party
        beneficiary thereof.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Governing Law and Disputes
      </h2>

      <p>
        Without regard to its conflict of law rules, this End User License Agreement shall be governed by and construed
        in
        accordance with the laws of the State of California and applicable federal laws of the United States. In the
        event
        of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms (“Dispute”), the parties shall first
        consult
        and negotiate with each other, directly or through their representatives, and, recognizing their mutual
        interests,
        attempt to reach a satisfactory resolution of the Dispute. If the parties do not resolve the Dispute to their
        mutual satisfaction within sixty (60) calendar days, then upon written notice by either party to the other, any
        unresolved Dispute shall be submitted to the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) for final and binding
        arbitration under the applicable commercial rules, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, in writing. The
        arbitration shall be held before a single arbitrator agreed upon by the parties or, in the event the parties do
        not agree, appointed by the applicable arbitral body. All AAA arbitration proceedings shall be held in
        California
        unless otherwise agreed by the parties and arbitrator.
      </p>

      <p>
        Without regard to the forum, any remedy and any award against YouApp and all of its parents, subsidiaries,
        affiliates, assigns, successors shall be limited to actual damages incurred and you shall not be entitled to any
        award or recovery for consequential, incidental, punitive, or exemplary damages.
      </p>

      <p>
        Arbitration of a Dispute is mandatory, except as stated otherwise in this End User License Agreement. Any
        lawsuit
        brought by you involving a Dispute that is not subject to arbitration, shall be resolved individually without
        resort to any form of class action litigation. Notwithstanding anything in this End User License Agreement, you
        shall retain the right to seek relief in a small claims court for any Dispute within the scope of its such
        court’s
        jurisdiction.
      </p>

      <p>
        YOU AND YOUAPP AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE PLATFORM MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE
        (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

        Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Denial Orders. You represent and
        warrant
        that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such country or on any such

        with or without your consent. You may not assign this End User License Agreement without YouApp’s prior written
        consent. Your assignment of this End User License Agreement without YouApp’s prior written consent shall be
        void.
        YouApp’s failure to enforce a provision of this End User License Agreement shall not be construed as a (1)
        waiver
        of such provision, or (2) diminishment of any right to enforce such provisions. Further, YouApp may choose to
        waive enforcement of a provision of this End User License Agreement in a particular instance; however, you are
        still obligated to comply with that waived provision in the future. YouApp shall not be liable for any delay or
        failure to perform resulting from causes outside the reasonable control of YouApp, such as natural disasters,
