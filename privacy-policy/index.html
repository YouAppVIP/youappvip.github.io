          your mobile device contacts YouApp servers. This information is used for troubleshooting and is stored on
          servers which may be located outside of your country of residence.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The information we collect enables us to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Provide the products and services that you request;

      <p>
        YouApp may use the e-mail address you provide to contact you. We use email to answer your online questions to us
        or requests for information. We send e-mail newsletters containing promotions of products and services, news,
        and information about upcoming events (if you have opted in, where required by law). Occasionally, we may
        contact you via email to ask for permission to reprint what you have written, as a testimonial, for use on our
        website or in our printed materials.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Sharing Information with Others
      </h2>

      <p>
        As a general rule, we do not sell or share your personal information with anyone outside YouApp, unless we are
        required to do so by law or as provided in this Privacy Policy. Under no circumstance does YouApp sell or share
        your personal information with third parties for commercial or marketing purposes.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following are the limited situations where we may share your personal information:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          We may share your personal information with trusted third parties that perform business functions (e.g.
          hosting of our website, analyzing data or technical monitoring of our systems) or provide services on our
          behalf
          (e.g. support services). We will request that all third parties adequately safeguard your personal information
          and only process it in accordance with our instructions.
        </li>

        <li>
          Upon the sale or transfer of YouApp and/or all or part of its assets, your personal information may be among
          the items sold or transferred.
        </li>

        <li>
          YouApp may share non-personal information publicly and with our partners. For example, we may publish trends
          about user activity concerning certain artists or genres of music on the website or app. We take steps to keep
          this non-personal information from being associated with specific end users and we require our partners to do
          the same.
        </li>

        <li>
          We may also disclose your personal information (i) to comply with any court order, law, or legal process,
          including to respond to any government or regulatory request; (ii) to enforce or apply our Terms of Service
          and other agreements, and (iii) if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights,
          property, or safety of YouApp, our customers, or others.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Sometimes YouApp offers you a service in cooperation with third parties. In such cases, we may exchange your
        personal information with these third parties to allow you to make optimal use of our combined services.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Your Access to Your Personal Information
      </h2>

      <p>
        You can request access to and have the opportunity to modify or delete personal information by contacting us
        using the information below. We reserve the right to take steps to authenticate your identity before providing
        access to your personal information. Subject to applicable law, we may charge you a small fee to access your
        personal information. We will provide individual access to any personal information we hold about them within 30
        days of any request for that information. Unless it is prohibited by law, we will remove any personal
        information about an individual from our servers at their request.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Security and Retention of Information
      </h2>

      <p>
        YouApp will make reasonable efforts to ensure that your personal information is properly secured using
        appropriate technical and organizational measures, so that they are protected against unauthorized or unlawful
        use, alteration, unauthorized access or disclosure, accidental or wrongful destruction, and loss. We will retain
        your information for as long as your account is active or as long as needed to provide you services. Following
        the deactivation of your account, we will retain your data for no longer than five years in most circumstances.
        We may, however, retain and use your information in order to comply with our legal obligations, resolve
        disputes, prevent abuse, and enforce our agreements. We do collect and retain "aggregate data," that is, group
        data with no personal identifiers, which is used to help us understand how the websites and app are being used
        and to improve its usability.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Notice of Breach of Security
      </h2>

      <p>
        Nobody is safe from hackers. If a security breach causes an unauthorized intrusion into our system that
        materially affects and/or presents a real risk of significant harm to you, then YouApp will notify you and
        others in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Privacy of Children
      </h2>

      <p>
        YouApp software and services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and any child under the
        age of 13 is strictly prohibited from using the YouApp software and services. Children under the age of 18 and
        over the age of 12 must obtain their parent or guardian’s permission before using YouApp software and services.

        information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at <a

      <p>
        YouApp may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to improve the convenience and

        are small electronic files, to track certain app statistics, such as recording the popularity of certain app
        content, and verifying system and server integrity. The following are the types of cookies that may be used on

      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Necessary cookies are required to make the Site function. For example, they permit website navigation, and

        <li>
          Statistics cookies, such as those deployed by Google and Countly. These cookies track user interactions and

      <p>
        We do not track our visitors across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore we do not
        respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities
        when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such
        sites, your internet browser may allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties
        (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.

        Facebook or Twitter pages. These features may collect information about your IP address and which page you’re
        visiting on our site, and they may set a cookie to make sure the feature functions properly. Social media
        features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. We also maintain

      <h2>
        Location of Information
